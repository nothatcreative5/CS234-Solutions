# CS234: Reinforcement Learning (Winter 2023)
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the CS234: Reinforcement Learning course offered by Stanford University. The assignments cover topics such as Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Multi-Agent RL.

## Assignments
The course has five assignments, which can be found in their respective directories:

- Assignment 1: Introduction to RL, MDP, DP, and Policy Evaluation
- Assignment 2: Monte Carlo Methods, Temporal Difference Learning, and Q-Learning
- Assignment 3: Function Approximation, Deep RL, and Actor-Critic Methods
- Assignment 4: Exploration, Model-based RL, and Inverse RL
- Assignment 5: Multi-Agent RL, Decentralized RL, and Hierarchical RL


## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.x installed, as well as the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Gym
- OpenAI Baseline
